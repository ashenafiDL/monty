# monty

This is another team project in the ALX SE program. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

This program is coded using C programming language and utilizes stacks and queues implemented using doubly linked list

### Usage

Clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ashenafiDL/monty.git
$ cd monty
```

Compile the program using gcc
```
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
```

Finally run the program using the following command:

```
./monty <file>
```

where `<fille>` is the path to the file containing Monty byte code
